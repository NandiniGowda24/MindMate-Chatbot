    <h3>Mother Teresa’s Compassion for Children</h3>
    <p>Mother Teresa devoted her life to caring for abandoned children in Calcutta. Click to read more.</p>
    <p class="full-text">
      She walked the streets, tended to the sick, and opened shelters where no one else would go. One day, she found a tiny baby left near a busy street. Holding the child close, she whispered comfort and ensured the little one received love, care, and hope. Her philosophy was simple: even a small act of love can ripple through the world, creating waves of kindness that touch countless lives.

    <h3>The Community Garden</h3>
    <p>A woman started a small garden in her neighborhood. Click to read more.</p>
    <p class="full-text">
      She planted flowers, vegetables, and herbs on a neglected plot, offering her harvest to anyone who needed it. Curious neighbors joined her, sharing seeds, tools, and stories. Soon, the garden became a hub of friendship, laughter, and cooperation. Children learned to plant and care for life, and the elderly found peace among the blooms. This small act grew into a flourishing symbol of hope and connection.

    <h3>Helping the Elderly</h3>
    <p>A young man visited a senior home every weekend. Click to read more.</p>
    <p class="full-text">
      He spent hours listening to stories of long lives filled with joys and sorrows, reading letters and poetry aloud, and celebrating birthdays. Residents who once felt invisible began to smile more, sharing memories and laughter with each other. One elderly woman, who had felt isolated for years, said she finally felt seen and valued again. These simple gestures reminded everyone that attention and compassion can profoundly change someone’s life.
